1. replace the proper configure file, for example, if you are using gfortran in linux system:
   cp configure_linux_gfortran.in configure.in

2. (optional) you can edit configure.in to adjust the configurations

3. make sure the appropriate compiler is loaded. (gfortran 4.7.3 + , ifort 14+), for example, if you are using gfortran you might want to load:
module load gcc/4.7.3
add this to ~/.bashrc so that you don't need to load the module every time.

4. run the shell script 
./compile.sh



If you want to recompile, do
./clear.sh
./compile.sh
